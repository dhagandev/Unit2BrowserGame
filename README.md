# General Pawsembly

### Concept and Motivation
I have always loved virtual pet care games and genetics. I decided to combine the two into a game where users need to take care of their dogs and can breed them in order to get dogs that have a better chance of having higher health stats.

### How to Play
In order to play, you must log in with a Google account. Once you are logged in, you can create your very own dog in the All Dogs page. You must make sure the dog has food, water, and feels loved. You can also abandon your dog, but remember, only the cruel do such an awful thing. If you have at least one male and one female dog, you can go to the puppy love page to breed them together and get more dogs.

* HTML
* CSS
